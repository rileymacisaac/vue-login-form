# Vue.js Login Form
This is a simple client-side login form built off of Vue. If this was code intended for production, I'd recommend building a progressively enhanced version that starts off with HTML5 validation and server-side validation. Then, if javascript is loaded, add all of this client-side validation. 

## Viewing login form
If you'd like to view everything quickly and just want to see the login form simply running, run `npm run serve`.

If you'd like to generate production quality code, run `npm run build`. To view the generated files in `/dist`, install and run the following:
```
npm install -g serve
serve -s dist
```
